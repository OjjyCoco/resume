# 🧑‍💻 My First Personal Website

This repository contains **my very first website**, built from scratch using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It's a simple yet meaningful project to me: **my personal CV hosted as a static site**.

At the time of its creation, I was just **19 years old**, exploring the world of web development for the first time. Although it's no longer maintained since **March 2024**, I’ve decided to keep it public as a reminder of how far I’ve come — and to show that we all start somewhere.

## 🚀 Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (vanilla)

## 📄 What It Is

A minimalist, fully static resume website. It features:

- A clean, readable layout  
- Basic styling and animations  
- No frameworks or external libraries  

## 💡 Notes

- This project is **no longer actively maintained**.  
- It represents an early step in my journey as a developer — please be kind when reviewing the code 😄  
- I'm proud of what I achieved with the little knowledge I had at the time.

## 📆 Last Update

**March 2024**
